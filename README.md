# LedGrid - Controlling NeoPixels with Go

The package `ledgrid` contains a number of types, which allows you to control
a chain of NeoPixels, lets you draw shapes, images and custom patterns and
provides you with methodsd to animate most of your stuff.

Beside the library itself, this package also contains some command line tools
like `anim`, a bunch of examples on how to use the package; `gridController`,
a daemon process which needs to be installed on the system where the LED-chain
is connected to or `gridEmulator` a GUI tool which lets you develop animations
_without_ the need of the NeoPixel hardware.
